STORY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You awaken in deep space and WOW, you sure are hungry! Good thing there are a
bunch of delicious-looking hunks of matter for you to consume. As a hideous
space demon, destroyer of planets and dreams, what better way to start the eon
than with a fulfilling breakfast composed of men, monsters, and planets?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to play GRAV-SMASH, you need to own either a 
TI-83+ or TI-84+ (Silver Editions will work too!). 
If you do not own either of these models of calculator, you
can play the game using an emulator.

Wabbit is the recommended emulator - http://wabbit.codeplex.com/
	*Try playing with the display settings for optimal appearance


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use TI Connect (or the connectivity software of your choice) to transfer
GRAVSMSH.8xp to your calculator.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING "GRAV-SMASH"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To play, run the command ASM(GRAVSMSH from the homescreen.

GRAV-SMASH has not been tested with any shells, however, they should work just
fine for your insatiable appetite for destruction!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GAMEPLAY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your goal is to get the objects flying through space close enough to you such
that they will be crushed by your powerful gravitational field. The closer an
object is to you, the more force you exert upon it, pulling it closer still.

You have a limited amount of time to destroy everything that you can find.
The timer bar is located on the left side of the screen, and counts down as time
passes. Every time you crush an object, your timer refills according to the
thrust power of said object.

Crush as much as you can before time runs out!
