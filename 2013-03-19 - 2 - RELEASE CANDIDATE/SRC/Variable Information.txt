A -- main sprite animation counter, also used to determine how many times an object moves per cycle
B -- main animation, which sprite to draw
D -- Distance between Object and Center, etc. (contributes to how much pull you have)
E -- Black Hole X
F -- Black Hole Y
G -- Random number used to generate direction of initial ship movement
H -- distance value, not absolute value
J -- used to handle stars, both generating and for drawing cycles
K -- Score
M -- Contrast when program is executed
N -- Number of objects
O -- used to cycle contrast down to starting position
P -- used to deal with the high score appvar
T -- Timer
X -- how much to decrement X by (i.e., pull that you exert on an object)
Y -- how much to decrement Y by (i.e., pull that you exert on an object)
Z -- object cycling counter, used for generation and movement purposes


Z+L1 - Obj X
Z+L2 - Obj Y
Z+N+L1 -- Object thrust (specific to object), also used to draw object (1-4 is possible)
Z+N+N+L1 -- Object moving X axis --> -1 = left, +1 = right, 0 = no
Z+N+N+L2 -- Object moving Y axis --> -1 = up, +1 down, 0 = no

{(J+N+N+N)+L1} -- star pos X
{(J+N+N+N)+L2} -- star pos Y
